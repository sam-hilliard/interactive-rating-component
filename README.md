## Overview

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating

## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Flexbox for positioning

### What I learned

I haven't used vanilla Javascript in a while (mostly rely on React for projects)
so this was a great refresher!


### Continued development

If I were to improve on this, I would add some error handling and popup indications
notifying the user if their submission was successful or not.

### Useful resources

- [This Medium Article](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-get-the-id-of-the-clicked-element-in-the-javascript-click-handler-8ca398d848d6) helped me to differentiate which button was clicked when my click handler was fired.
